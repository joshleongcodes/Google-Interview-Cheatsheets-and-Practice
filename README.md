<h1>Google Interview Cheatsheets and Practice</h1>
<p>
	This repo was made for opportunity. Anyone who has the opportunity to interview at Google knows the amount of work you have to put in to get it. I want everyone to be able to share this opportunity. So I made a repo with all the work that I have done to showcase what you might expect, and how to better prepare for it. Best of luck!

<p>The interviewer will be evaluating your:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Coding ability in <i>[What ever language you picked]</i>. Recommended C/C++, GO, Java or Objective-C.</li>
	<li>Data structures and algorithms</li>
	<li>Problem solving & communication skills</li>
</ul>

<h2>1) Interview Questions:</h2>
<p>
You will be coding on a Google Doc for the phone interview. Interview topics may cover anything on your resume, but will mostly involve Javascript coding questions, building and developing complex algorithms and analyzing their performance characteristics, logic problems, and core computer science principles - hash tables, stacks, arrays, etc. Computer Science fundamentals are prerequisite for all engineering roles at Google, regardless of seniority, due to the complexities and global scale of the projects you would end up participating in.
</p>

<h2>2) How to Succeed:</h2>
<p>
	Most questions your interviewer asks are under-specified so you may need to ask clarifying questions before you start working on a solution. If you need to make assumptions, state those assumptions to your interviewer. Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she is as interested in your thought process and how you approach the problem as the solution itself. Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're doing. If there is anything you don’t understand - it is okay to ask your interviewer for help or clarification.
	When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it. If you need to assume something - verbally check that it is a correct assumption. Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.

</p>
 
<h2>3) Algorithms and Data Structures:</h2>
<p>
	You likely will be asked to design an algorithm and write code without using an editor or pseudo-code. Be very comfortable with Big-O analysis of running-time complexity. Be prepared to explain the running-time complexity of algorithms you know and are asked to devise.
	Don’t be afraid to iterate through the problems presented to you - your interviewer is interested in knowing if you understand the problem and can answer it.  Remember to leave time to focus on utilizing better data structures and algorithms.
</p>
 
 
<h2>4) Coding:</h2>
<p>
	Practice on blank Google Doc or a whiteboard. Come up with solutions quickly! Time yourself to finish 2-3 problems within 45 minutes. Make sure your code is clean, bug-free and properly handles edge cases. If you need to write pseudo-code to gather your thoughts first, verbally tell the interviewer this is what you're doing.
	You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. For example, if your particular language supports a sort function, you do not need to write your own sort routine unless the interviewer specifically requests otherwise.
</p>
 
<p>Google is keen to see really high quality, efficient, clear code without typing mistakes. Because all engineers (at every level) collaborate throughout the Google code base, with an efficient code review process, it’s essential that every engineer works at the same high standard.<p>
 
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Sorting:</h3>
		<p>Know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Hashtables:</h3>
		<p>Arguably the single most important data structure. You absolutely should know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one 45 minute interview.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Trees:</h3>
		<p>
		Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Graphs:</h3>
		<p>
		Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and it’s pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code.
